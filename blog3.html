            <p>When you start a new blog, one of your most important decisions is choosing what blogging software to use. You also need to decide what type of blogger you’ll be. Is there a certain niche that would be a great fit to match your interests and expertise? Whether you’re a new blogger or looking to switch blogging platforms, the range of blogging tools and options you find here can give you a head start on your search for your blogging software and blog niche match.</p>

            <p>When you choose to blog using a hosted blog service, you don’t need to worry about the software technology at all. You can concentrate on the topic for your next blog post, rather than on how to configure a web server. To use hosted blogging software, you log into the editing tool, write a post, click the Publish button, and log out.</p>
        
            <p>Parenting: One of the most popular blogging areas, this niche continues to grow by leaps and bounds and includes both mom and dad bloggers writing about everything from life as a parent to the latest and greatest products for kids.</p>
        
            <p>Hobbies: Are you a knitting genius? Perhaps you’ve become an expert on the ukulele. Whatever your hobby, why not consider blogging about your experience and joining a large community of other bloggers doing the same.</p>
